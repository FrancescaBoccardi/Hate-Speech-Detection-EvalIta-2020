# Hate Speech Detection EvalIta 2020

Identifying hate content in social media is a crucial mission, as online hate speech can be potentially dangerous and harm marginalized individuals or groups. In this perspective, the
aim of this study is to compare different methods and architectures, namely ML, RNN and Transformer-based models, to address the tasks of Hate Speech Detection and Stereotype Detection.
The experiments were run on a corpus of Italian tweets given by EvalIta for the [2020 HaSpeeDe challenge](http://www.di.unito.it/~tutreeb/haspeede-evalita20/index.html).
